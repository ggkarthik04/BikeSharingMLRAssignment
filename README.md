## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
- We need to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
- This datset is provided by a US Bike Sharing company 'BoomBikes' for the years 2018 and 2019.

## Conclusions
- 12 Predictor variables selected out of 30 variables to develop the best version of Linear regression model
- R-squared of training and testing dataset were calculated
- Mathematical Expression of model was derived
- Understood major predictor variables impacting the target variable and their coefficients
